# MerkelRex Crypto Trading Platform
This project is a simulated cryptocurrency exchange developed as the central project in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Specialization course, particularly using the C++ programming language.The platform is designed to help learners understand and apply core OOP concepts by building a realistic, interactive application

The MerkelRex platform is a practical demonstration of OOP principles in C++, with a focus on:
1. Modeling real-world entities as classes and objects
2. Using encapsulation and abstraction to protect and manage data
3. Applying inheritance and polymorphism for code reuse and flexibility
4. Managing object state and interactions to simulate a functioning crypto exchange
5. This methodology not only results in a robust simulation but also provides learners with a deep, hands-on understanding of object-oriented programming in a real-world context.
