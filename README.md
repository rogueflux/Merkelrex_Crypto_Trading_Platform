# MerkelRex Crypto Trading Platform
This project is a simulated cryptocurrency exchange developed as the central project in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Specialization course, particularly using the C++ programming language.The platform is designed to help learners understand and apply core OOP concepts by building a realistic, interactive application

The MerkelRex platform is a practical demonstration of OOP principles in C++, with a focus on:
•	Modeling real-world entities as classes and objects
•	Using encapsulation and abstraction to protect and manage data
•	Applying inheritance and polymorphism for code reuse and flexibility
•	Managing object state and interactions to simulate a functioning crypto exchange
•	This methodology not only results in a robust simulation but also provides learners with a deep, hands-on understanding of object-oriented programming in a real-world context.
