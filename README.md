# MerkelRex Crypto Trading Platform
This project is a simulated cryptocurrency exchange developed as the central project in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Specialization course, particularly using the C++ programming language.The platform is designed to help learners understand and apply core OOP concepts by building a realistic, interactive application

Key Features and Structure:
1. Incremental Development: The platform is constructed over five courses, with each stage introducing new OOP principles and programming techniques. This step-by-step approach allows learners to gradually build a fully functional trading system.
2. Object-Oriented Design: Students model real-world entities—such as wallets, orders, and trades—as C++ classes. This involves encapsulating data (like balances or order details) and related functions (such as deposit, withdraw, place order) within each class.
3. Wallet Management: A major focus is on the Wallet class, which tracks users’ balances in various cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Learners implement functions to insert funds, check for sufficient balances, and remove funds as trades are executed.
4. Order Matching and Trading: The platform simulates the process of placing bids and asks, matching buy and sell orders, and updating user wallets accordingly. This involves handling object interactions and maintaining state within the application.
5. Command-Line Interface: User interaction is handled via the command line, allowing users to input commands to place orders, check balances, and view transaction history.
